# Titanic Survival Project

Everyone has heard about the tragic sinking of the Titanic over a century ago. Data on the passengers is available: for example, their gender, how many family members were on board, their age, and most importantly: if they survived or not. I analysed this data and made a prediction using a Random Forest.

### What files are needed?
All the files that you need are included in the project folder. They are:
    1. Titanic analysis (with Random Forest).ipynb  -- This is the file you need to run
    2. train.csv -- This is the dataset used for training of the model.
    3. test.csv -- This is the dataset used for testing.
