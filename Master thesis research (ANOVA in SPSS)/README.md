# Master Thesis research
At the request of the NWO (Dutch Research Council) I conducted my masters research on the effects of implicit gender bias in selection procedures. Not only that, but I also researched ways to prevent this gender bias to affect selection procedures. How cool is that? I loved contributing to more gender equality in our society, and hope that my research helps fight other areas of structural societal inequality as well.

Of course I did some neat analyses (like ANOVA) to analyse the data I gathered for this experimental research. 
This research was the highlight of my Master's degree, and I hope you enjoy reading it.
