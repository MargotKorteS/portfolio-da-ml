# Portfolio for Data Analysis and Machine Learning

Hi there!

Welcome to my portfolio. In this portfolio I highlight my experience with programming, data analysis and machine learning.
In the folders you'll find a selection of the projects I've done. I'll frequently be updating this. 

Currently, my portfolio contains the following projects:

Projects that demonstrate my diverse programming skills 😎
    1. Snake game. My awesome, multicoloured version of the classic, made with Turtle using Object Oriented Programming (OOP).🐍🐍🐍
    2. Flight Finder. A useful tool to find cheap flights across the world, while you get to set all of the parameters. Using API-requests and SMTP, all in OOP of course. ✈ 🤑

Projects highlighting my experience with data analysis and machine learning 🎢🙀
    1. Top 50 Technology Companies. Interesting Data Analysis project exploring and visualizing the stats of the top 50 Tech companies in 2022.🎧🎮💻🍏
    2. Yelp review project. Always wanted to find out if a Yelp-review is 1 or 5 stars, without actually having to count them? Look no further! I built a model to classify reviews using Natural Language Processing. 🏞 🗯 🔁
    3. Titanic project. I built a classification model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic, using a Random Forest.🌳🌳🌳🌳🌳

I have also added my Master thesis on the effects of gender bias in selection procedures, for those interested in the analyses I did during my own research. 👩‍🎓👩‍🏫👩‍🔧👩‍💻👩‍🔬

If you'd like to see more of my work, or wonder if I have experience with a specific kind of analysis, do not hesitate to contact me.📜✒🕊📧🔥
