# portfolio-da-ml
Welcome to my portfolio! In this portfolio I highlight my experience with programming, data analysis and machine learning.
In the folders you'll find a selection of the projects I've done. I'll frequently be updating this. 
I have also added my Master thesis, for those interested in the analyses I did during my own research.

If you'd like to see more of my work, or wonder if I have experience with a specific kind of analysis, do not hesitate to contact me.
