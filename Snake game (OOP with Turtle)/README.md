# The Snake Game
A remake of the classic. This time more colourful and at a challenging speed. I made it using OOP and many other smart ideas.
What is your highscore? (Mine is 22, which took both skill and snake charming)


### What files are needed?
All the files that you need are included in the project folder. They are:
    1. main.py  -- This is the file you need to run
    2. food.py -- This file contains code that creates the food
    3. scoreboard.py -- This file contains code that creates and updates the scoreboard
    4. snake.py -- This file manages the snake's appearance and speed
    5. high_score.txt -- This is (for now) an empty file that keeps track of your high score once you start playing
